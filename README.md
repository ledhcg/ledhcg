## .Quote of the Day.

```html
"President Trump says his highest priority is America and the American people. The fact that this idea has been met with shock is itself shocking; if America's success is not the president's goal, what is? Is it looking good in photo-ops, while debt grows, jobs dwindle, bureaucracy reigns supreme, and the American people suffer?"
<!-- Matt Gaetz -->
